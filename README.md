# Gargoyle Router Management Utility

Gargoyle is a third party firmware for routers based on the Openwrt firmware. It can be described at a high level as a front-end to Openwrt, however there are several packages and custom kernel modules which are not included upstream in Openwrt. As a result, Gargoyle cannot be installed as a set-of-packages to an existing Openwrt installation, and is a separate firmware as far as installation is concerned.
Gargoyle is open-source software, and aims to be the first open-source firmware project to place a strong focus on creating a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

As a developer, or even a casual contributor, you should start [here](https://www.gargoyle-router.com/wiki/doku.php?id=developer_info) at the Gargoyle wiki developer documentation.
You should always consult the wiki for up to date information on getting started (as it is maintained by the community, and this readme may not receive as much attention), however as a brief summary...

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites assume a 64bit Ubuntu system. Many devs use virtual machines, and they are perfectly fine for this kind of work.

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential asciidoc binutils bzip2 gawk gettext git libncurses5-dev libz-dev patch unzip zlib1g-dev lib32gcc1 libc6-dev-i386 subversion flex uglifyjs git-core gcc-multilib p7zip p7zip-full msmtp libssl-dev texinfo npm
```

### Get the source

You've already found it if you're reading this, but lets get it on your local machine. Choose one of the following commands depending on whether you want to use SSH or HTTPS authentication:

```
git@github.com:ericpaulbishop/gargoyle.git
https://github.com/ericpaulbishop/gargoyle.git
```

Then

```
cd gargoyle
```


## Building Gargoyle

After building is complete, you'll have <target>-src/, built/<target> and images/<target> folders. Retrieve your compiled firmwares from images, and the packages from built.

### Make all targets

```
make FULL_BUILD=true
```

### Make a single target (e.g. ar71xx)

```
make ar71xx FULL_BUILD=true
```

### Make a single profile (e.g. ar71xx.usb_large)

```
make ar71xx.usb_large FULL_BUILD=true
```

### Make a single target (e.g. ar71xx) without rebuilding Openwrt (just packages)

```
make ar71xx
```

### Make a custom target

See the wiki for more detailed instructions.

```
make custom
```

## Install

Please see the relevant Openwrt wiki or ToH entries for your device for the intricacies of installation, upgrading and failsafe for your device.

## Reporting an issue or bug

If you have discovered a genuine bug or other shortcoming in the firmware that you would like addressed, please first check the forums to see if it has already been raised and addressed. If the community is not able to address it for you, or the consensus is that it is a genuine bug, please raise an issue in GitHub.
**NOTE** Issues are not the place for feature requests. Please keep these to the forum.
Include as much detail as you can, such as:
* Gargoyle Version
* Router Make, Model and Version
* What were you doing when the bug occurred?
* What happened (what's the bug)?
* What did you expect to happen (what is your expectation of the proper behaviour)?
* Can you reproduce the bug everytime, sometimes, rarely? (For rare issues, start with the forums and see if others are seeing the same issue)
* Exact steps to reproduce the bug
